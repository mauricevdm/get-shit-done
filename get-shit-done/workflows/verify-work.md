<purpose>
Validate built features through conversational testing with persistent state. Creates UAT.md that tracks test progress, survives /clear, and feeds gaps into /gsd:plan-phase --gaps.

User tests, Claude records. One test at a time. Plain text responses.
</purpose>

<philosophy>
**Show expected, ask if reality matches.**

Claude presents what SHOULD happen. User confirms or describes what's different.
- "yes" / "y" / "next" / empty → pass
- Anything else → logged as issue, severity inferred

No Pass/Fail buttons. No severity questions. Just: "Here's what should happen. Does it?"
</philosophy>

<step name="initialize" priority="first">
If $ARGUMENTS contains a phase number, load context:

```bash
INIT=$(node ~/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs init verify-work "${PHASE_ARG}")
```

Parse JSON for: `planner_model`, `checker_model`, `commit_docs`, `phase_found`, `phase_dir`, `phase_number`, `phase_name`, `has_verification`.
</step>

<step name="check_active_session">
**First: Check for active UAT sessions**

```bash
find .planning/phases -name "*-UAT.md" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

**If active sessions exist AND no $ARGUMENTS provided:**

Read each file's frontmatter (status, phase) and Current Test section.

Display inline:

```
## Active UAT Sessions

| # | Phase | Status | Current Test | Progress |
|---|-------|--------|--------------|----------|
| 1 | 04-comments | testing | 3. Reply to Comment | 2/6 |
| 2 | 05-auth | testing | 1. Login Form | 0/4 |

Reply with a number to resume, or provide a phase number to start new.
```

Wait for user response.

- If user replies with number (1, 2) → Load that file, go to `resume_from_file`
- If user replies with phase number → Treat as new session, go to `create_uat_file`

**If active sessions exist AND $ARGUMENTS provided:**

Check if session exists for that phase. If yes, offer to resume or restart.
If no, continue to `create_uat_file`.

**If no active sessions AND no $ARGUMENTS:**

```
No active UAT sessions.

Provide a phase number to start testing (e.g., /gsd:verify-work 4)
```

**If no active sessions AND $ARGUMENTS provided:**

Continue to `create_uat_file`.
</step>

<step name="find_summaries">
**Find what to test:**

Use `phase_dir` from init (or run init if not already done).

**1. Read phase section from ROADMAP.md:**

```bash
cat .planning/ROADMAP.md
```

Parse the ROADMAP to find the phase matching `phase_number` or `phase_name`.
Extract the **Success Criteria** section for that phase (numbered list under `**Success Criteria:**` or `**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):`).

**2. Find SUMMARY.md files:**

```bash
ls "$phase_dir"/*-SUMMARY.md 2>/dev/null
```

Read each SUMMARY.md to extract implementation details.
</step>

<step name="extract_success_criteria">
**Extract phase success criteria from ROADMAP.md (PRIMARY TESTS):**

Parse the **Success Criteria** section found in find_summaries step.
Each numbered criterion becomes a "Phase Goal" test.

For each criterion, create a test with:
- name: Brief test name from criterion
- expected: Observable verification that proves the criterion is met
- source: "ROADMAP Success Criteria #N"
- category: "Phase Goal"

**Generate intelligent verification methods based on phase type:**

| Phase Type | Indicators | Verification Approach |
|------------|------------|----------------------|
| Infrastructure | "provision", "deploy", "create resource" | Azure CLI commands, Terraform state checks |
| API/Backend | "endpoint", "API", "service" | curl/httpie commands, API response validation |
| Frontend/UI | "dashboard", "UI", "display" | Browser verification, visual inspection |
| Data Pipeline | "download", "ingest", "index" | Blob counts, database queries, metrics |
| Worker/Job | "worker", "job", "process" | Log verification, state tracker checks |

**Examples:**
- Criterion: "FTP download worker can connect to ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"
  → Name: "FTP Server Connection"
  → Expected: "FTP client establishes connection to ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov (verify via logs or test connection)"

- Criterion: "~1,200 baseline XML files downloaded to Blob Storage"
  → Name: "Baseline Files in Blob Storage"
  → Expected: "Azure blob container shows ~1,200 XML files (run: `az storage blob list --container pubmed-raw --query 'length(@)'`)"

- Criterion: "All files pass MD5 checksum validation"
  → Name: "MD5 Validation Complete"
  → Expected: "State tracker shows all downloads completed with status 'validated' (no checksum failures)"

**If no Success Criteria found in ROADMAP:**
- Log: "No Success Criteria found in ROADMAP for phase {phase}. Using SUMMARY.md only."
- Continue to extract_tests with empty success criteria list
</step>

<step name="extract_tests">
**Extract implementation tests from SUMMARY.md (SECONDARY TESTS):**

Parse each SUMMARY.md for:
1. **Accomplishments** - Features/functionality added
2. **User-facing changes** - UI, workflows, interactions

Focus on FUNCTIONAL verification, not existence checks.

For each deliverable, create a test with:
- name: Brief test name
- expected: What the user should see/experience (specific, observable)
- source: The SUMMARY.md filename (e.g., "MASS-02-01-SUMMARY.md")
- category: "Implementation"

**Generate functional tests, not import checks:**

BAD (existence check):
- "MD5 module imports successfully"
- "Retry handler function exists"

GOOD (functional verification):
- "MD5 validation detects corrupt file and reports failure"
- "Retry handler recovers from temporary FTP disconnection"

**Examples:**
- Accomplishment: "FTP streaming client that downloads directly to blob without loading full file in memory"
  → Name: "FTP Streaming to Blob"
  → Expected: "Large file download completes without memory spike (verify via logs showing chunk uploads)"

- Accomplishment: "Added comment threading with infinite nesting"
  → Name: "Reply to a Comment"
  → Expected: "Clicking Reply opens inline composer below comment. Submitting shows reply nested under parent with visual indentation."

Skip internal/non-observable items (refactors, type changes, etc.).
</step>

<step name="create_uat_file">
**Create UAT file with categorized tests:**

```bash
mkdir -p "$PHASE_DIR"
```

Build test list from:
1. Success Criteria (from extract_success_criteria) - numbered first
2. Implementation details (from extract_tests) - numbered after

Create file:

- Contains: doesn't work, wrong, missing, can't → major
- Contains: slow, weird, off, minor, small → minor
- Contains: color, font, spacing, alignment, visual → cosmetic
- Default if unclear: major

Update Tests section:
```
### {N}. {name}

**Infer severity from user's natural language:**

| "works but...", "slow", "weird", "minor issue" | minor |

Default to **major** if unclear. User can correct if needed.

**Never ask "how severe is this?"** - just infer and move on.
