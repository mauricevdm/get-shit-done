# Project State: GSD v1.1 Upstream Sync

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** Enable GSD fork maintainers to stay current with upstream while preserving custom enhancements through intelligent sync tooling.

**Current Focus:** Phase 5 - Core Infrastructure (configure, fetch, status, notifications)

## Current Position

**Phase:** 5 - Core Infrastructure
**Plan:** 5-04 complete, 5-05 ready
**Status:** Milestone complete
**Last activity:** 2026-02-24 — Completed plan 5-04 (notification check functions)

```
[########............] 40% - Phase 5 plan 4 complete
```

**Phases:**
- [ ] Phase 5: Core Infrastructure (7 requirements)
- [ ] Phase 6: Analysis (4 requirements)
- [ ] Phase 7: Merge Operations (4 requirements)
- [ ] Phase 8: Interactive & Integration (5 requirements)
- [ ] Phase 9: Documentation (4 requirements)

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Plans completed (v1.1) | 4 |
| Plans failed (v1.1) | 0 |
| Current streak | 4 |
| v1.0 plans completed | 11 |

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions (from v1.0 + v1.1 research)

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Directory-based locks | mkdir is POSIX-atomic, survives crashes better than flock | 2026-02-20 |
| JSON registry for worktrees | Explicit state beats parsing git worktree list output | 2026-02-20 |
| ESM-in-CJS pattern | Use dynamic import() with init() for ESM-only remark packages | 2026-02-22 |
| Section strategies per CONTEXT.md | Exact match to ownership table (additive, union, worktree-wins) | 2026-02-22 |
| Three-way diff3 for conflicts | node-diff3 algorithm used by Google Docs | 2026-02-22 |
| Modular code structure | Match upstream's lib/ pattern for easier merges | 2026-02-23 |
| Merge strategy for upstream | Never use reset; auto-create backup branch; merge not rebase | 2026-02-23 |
| Separate STATE.md strategy for upstream | Fork state wins for phase sections; don't reuse worktree merge code | 2026-02-23 |
| lib/upstream.cjs module | Follow worktree.cjs/health.cjs pattern; pure functions, testable | 2026-02-23 |
| Auto-detect upstream URL | Check git remotes, use existing 'upstream' if present | 2026-02-24 |
| Cache upstream fetch metadata | Store commits_behind, last_fetch, last_sha in config.json | 2026-02-24 |
| Unicode escape for emojis | Use \uXXXX format for cross-platform compatibility | 2026-02-24 |
| Conventional commit grouping | Group by COMMIT_TYPES order; fallback to flat list | 2026-02-24 |
| Cache-first notification check | Fast response for session start, no blocking network calls | 2026-02-24 |
| Silent network errors for notifications | Session start should never fail due to network issues | 2026-02-24 |
| Quote shell arguments in execGit | Prevent shell interpretation of special chars (%, |, etc.) | 2026-02-24 |
| Human-readable output mode | Support text > 20 chars as human-readable in output function | 2026-02-24 |

### Implementation Notes

- Git worktree 2.17+ required for `--lock` flag
- ESM modules in CJS: Use async `init()` with dynamic `import()` for remark ecosystem
- Upstream repo: `https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done`
- Fork repo: `git@github.com:mauricevdm/get-shit-done.git`
- git merge-tree (Git 2.38+) for conflict preview, with legacy fallback
- Force push detection needed before sync operations
- Commit grouping by directory when conventional commits not present

### Open Questions

- How to handle partial merges (some features but not others)?
- Commit grouping heuristics when conventional commits not used?
- STATE.md upstream merge strategy for structural migrations?

### TODOs

- [x] Define v1.1 requirements
- [x] Create roadmap
- [x] Plan Phase 5
- [x] Execute plan 5-01 (upstream.cjs with configure/fetch)
- [x] Execute plan 5-02 (status and log commands)
- [x] Execute plan 5-03 (gsd-tools CLI routing)
- [x] Execute plan 5-04 (notification check functions)
- [ ] Execute plan 5-05 (session workflow integration)

### Blockers

None currently.

## Session Continuity

**Last Session:** 2026-02-24
**Context:** Completed plan 5-04 - added checkUpstreamNotification and formatNotificationBanner to upstream.cjs. Uses 24-hour cache, handles network errors silently. CLI command `upstream notification` available with --refresh flag.

**To Resume:**
1. Execute plan 5-05 (session workflow integration)
2. Continue through remaining Phase 5 plans
