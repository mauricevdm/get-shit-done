## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions (from v1.0 + v1.1 research)

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Directory-based locks | mkdir is POSIX-atomic, survives crashes better than flock | 2026-02-20 |
| JSON registry for worktrees | Explicit state beats parsing git worktree list output | 2026-02-20 |
| ESM-in-CJS pattern | Use dynamic import() with init() for ESM-only remark packages | 2026-02-22 |
| Section strategies per CONTEXT.md | Exact match to ownership table (additive, union, worktree-wins) | 2026-02-22 |
| Three-way diff3 for conflicts | node-diff3 algorithm used by Google Docs | 2026-02-22 |
| Modular code structure | Match upstream's lib/ pattern for easier merges | 2026-02-23 |
| Merge strategy for upstream | Never use reset; auto-create backup branch; merge not rebase | 2026-02-23 |
| Separate STATE.md strategy for upstream | Fork state wins for phase sections; don't reuse worktree merge code | 2026-02-23 |
| lib/upstream.cjs module | Follow worktree.cjs/health.cjs pattern; pure functions, testable | 2026-02-23 |
| Auto-detect upstream URL | Check git remotes, use existing 'upstream' if present | 2026-02-24 |
| Cache upstream fetch metadata | Store commits_behind, last_fetch, last_sha in config.json | 2026-02-24 |
| Unicode escape for emojis | Use \uXXXX format for cross-platform compatibility | 2026-02-24 |
| Conventional commit grouping | Group by COMMIT_TYPES order; fallback to flat list | 2026-02-24 |
| Cache-first notification check | Fast response for session start, no blocking network calls | 2026-02-24 |
| Silent network errors for notifications | Session start should never fail due to network issues | 2026-02-24 |
| Quote shell arguments in execGit | Prevent shell interpretation of special chars (%, |, etc.) | 2026-02-24 |
| Human-readable output mode | Support text > 20 chars as human-readable in output function | 2026-02-24 |
| Git version check for merge-tree | Check Git 2.38+ before using --write-tree | 2026-02-24 |
| Risk scoring thresholds | easy (<2), moderate (<5), hard (>=5) with file type weights | 2026-02-24 |
| Binary file categories | safe (images/fonts), review (archives), dangerous (executables) | 2026-02-24 |
| Analysis state in config.json | Store analyzed_sha, conflict_count, binary_acknowledged | 2026-02-24 |
| 90% rename similarity threshold | Reduces false positives from unrelated files | 2026-02-24 |
| Fork modification check | Only flag conflicts where fork actually changed the file | 2026-02-24 |
| Adaptive directory depth | Refine at >50% clustering AND >5 total commits; cap at 2 levels | 2026-02-24 |
| Workflow commands at commands/gsd/ | Discovered actual path differs from documentation; commands discoverable there | 2026-02-24 |
| Sync History in STATE.md | Section placed below Session Continuity; entries newest-first | 2026-02-24 |
| Backup branch UTC timestamps | YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS format; fail on duplicate (incomplete sync indicator) | 2026-02-24 |
| Block restore on dirty working tree | Prevents data loss by requiring clean state before restore | 2026-02-24 |
| MERGE_HEAD detection for abort | Use git's MERGE_HEAD file to detect in-progress merge | 2026-02-24 |
| Automatic rollback on merge failure | Any merge failure triggers immediate rollback to pre-merge state | 2026-02-24 |
| Pre-merge validation sequence | 4 checks before merge: upstream configured, clean tree, no merge in progress, commits available | 2026-02-24 |
| Linear chronological navigation | Explore REPL uses next/prev for commit navigation instead of jump-to-hash | 2026-02-24 |
| Smart diff preview threshold | 50 lines - summary for larger diffs, full diff otherwise | 2026-02-24 |
| AI escape hatch via ask command | Format structured prompt for Claude analysis of commits | 2026-02-24 |
| Hard block on sync with active worktrees | Protects in-progress work; force flag available | 2026-02-24 |
| Divergence severity levels | none (0), low (<=5), medium (<=20), high (>20) total commits | 2026-02-24 |
| Health check sync integration | Detect stale analysis, SHA mismatch, orphaned state | 2026-02-24 |
| Suggestion severity levels | high=renames, medium=signatures, low=imports | 2026-02-24 |
| Patch file approach for renames | Generate patch files for review rather than auto-apply | 2026-02-24 |
| Config-backed suggestion storage | Store suggestions in config.json for persistence | 2026-02-24 |
| Three-tier test discovery | Naming conventions first, then import analysis; coverage data optional | 2026-02-24 |
| Non-TTY defaults to keep changes | Allows batch/CI use without hanging on prompt | 2026-02-24 |

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 06.1 inserted after Phase 6: Local Modifications Integration (URGENT)
  - Downstream note: After 6.1 completes, verify Phase 7 plans use project-local paths (gsd/ not ~/.claude/)

### Implementation Notes

- Git worktree 2.17+ required for `--lock` flag
- ESM modules in CJS: Use async `init()` with dynamic `import()` for remark ecosystem
- Upstream repo: `https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done`
- Fork repo: `git@github.com:mauricevdm/get-shit-done.git`
- git merge-tree (Git 2.38+) for conflict preview, with legacy fallback
- Force push detection needed before sync operations
- Commit grouping by directory when conventional commits not present

### Open Questions

- How to handle partial merges (some features but not others)?
- Commit grouping heuristics when conventional commits not used?
- STATE.md upstream merge strategy for structural migrations?

### Blockers

None currently.

## Session Continuity

**Last Session:** 2026-02-24
**Context:** Completed plan 8-03 - added test-discovery.cjs module with three-tier discovery (naming conventions, import analysis) and integrated runPostMergeVerification into cmdUpstreamMerge with rollback prompt on test failure.

**To Resume:**
1. Phase 8 (Interactive & Integration) complete
2. Next: Phase 9 - Documentation
