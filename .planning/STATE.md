# Project State: GSD Worktree Isolation

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** Enable parallel phase execution through git worktree isolation — multiple AI sessions can work on different phases simultaneously without file conflicts.

**Current Focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation (worktree lifecycle and lock mechanism)

## Current Position

**Phase:** 1 - Foundation
**Plan:** 2 of 3
**Status:** Executing Phase 1

```
[#############       ] 66% - Plans 01-01, 01-02 complete
```

**Phases:**
- [ ] Phase 1: Foundation (10 requirements)
- [ ] Phase 2: Workflow Integration (7 requirements)
- [ ] Phase 3: State Reconciliation (4 requirements)
- [ ] Phase 4: Polish and Recovery (3 requirements)

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Plans completed | 2 |
| Plans failed | 0 |
| Current streak | 2 |
| Retries used | 0 |

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| 4-phase structure | Research recommended: Foundation -> Integration -> Reconciliation -> Polish | 2026-02-20 |
| Directory-based locks | mkdir is POSIX-atomic, survives crashes better than flock | 2026-02-20 |
| JSON registry for worktrees | Explicit state beats parsing git worktree list output | 2026-02-20 |
| Sibling directory worktrees | Predictable paths, no nested .gitignore complexity | 2026-02-20 |
| Lock directory pattern | .planning/worktrees/locks/phase-{N}/ with info.json metadata | 2026-02-20 |
| Stale lock detection via PID | kill -0 to check process existence, return 0 for stale | 2026-02-20 |
| Mark removed worktrees | Preserve history with status: removed instead of deleting | 2026-02-20 |
| Absolute paths in registry | Use path.resolve() for consistent worktree path storage | 2026-02-20 |

### Implementation Notes

- Git worktree 2.17+ required for `--lock` flag
- Use `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` for repo root (worktree .git is a file)
- Never `rm -rf` worktree directories, always use `git worktree remove`
- Post-create hooks must run before returning success

### Open Questions

- Stale lock recovery TTL: 24 hours suggested but needs validation
- Partial merge handling: stop + manual resolution + no auto-cleanup
- Submodule support: incomplete per Git docs, defer to hooks if needed

### TODOs

- [x] Plan Phase 1 with `/gsd:plan-phase 1`
- [x] Implement phase-worktree.sh lock functions (01-02)
- [x] Add worktree subcommands to gsd-tools.cjs (01-01)
- [ ] Implement worktree lifecycle operations (01-03)

### Blockers

None currently.

## Session Continuity

**Last Session:** 2026-02-20
**Context:** Plan 01-01 complete. Worktree and lock registry commands added to gsd-tools.cjs.

**To Resume:**
1. Execute Plan 01-03 (worktree lifecycle operations)
2. Requirements completed: LOCK-01, LOCK-02, LOCK-03, TREE-02, TREE-03, LOCK-04, STATE-01
