# Project State: GSD Worktree Isolation

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** Enable parallel phase execution through git worktree isolation — multiple AI sessions can work on different phases simultaneously without file conflicts.

**Current Focus:** Phase 2 - Workflow Integration (execute-phase and finalize-phase)

## Current Position

**Phase:** 2 - Workflow Integration
**Plan:** 02-01 complete, ready for 02-02, 02-03
**Status:** Executing

```
[#######-------------] 33% - Plan 02-01 complete, 02-02 and 02-03 ready
```

**Phases:**
- [x] Phase 1: Foundation (10 requirements) - COMPLETE
- [ ] Phase 2: Workflow Integration (7 requirements) - IN PROGRESS (1/3 plans complete)
- [ ] Phase 3: State Reconciliation (4 requirements)
- [ ] Phase 4: Polish and Recovery (3 requirements)

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Plans completed | 4 |
| Plans failed | 0 |
| Current streak | 4 |
| Retries used | 0 |
| 02-01 duration | 88s |

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| 4-phase structure | Research recommended: Foundation -> Integration -> Reconciliation -> Polish | 2026-02-20 |
| Directory-based locks | mkdir is POSIX-atomic, survives crashes better than flock | 2026-02-20 |
| JSON registry for worktrees | Explicit state beats parsing git worktree list output | 2026-02-20 |
| Sibling directory worktrees | Predictable paths, no nested .gitignore complexity | 2026-02-20 |
| Lock directory pattern | .planning/worktrees/locks/phase-{N}/ with info.json metadata | 2026-02-20 |
| Stale lock detection via PID | kill -0 to check process existence, return 0 for stale | 2026-02-20 |
| Mark removed worktrees | Preserve history with status: removed instead of deleting | 2026-02-20 |
| Absolute paths in registry | Use path.resolve() for consistent worktree path storage | 2026-02-20 |
| Unlock worktree before remove | Git requires unlock before removing --lock worktrees | 2026-02-20 |
| Non-fatal post-create hooks | npm install and .env copy should warn, not fail worktree creation | 2026-02-20 |

### Implementation Notes

- Git worktree 2.17+ required for `--lock` flag
- Use `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` for repo root (worktree .git is a file)
- Never `rm -rf` worktree directories, always use `git worktree remove`
- Post-create hooks must run before returning success
- Script path is `get-shit-done/bin/phase-worktree.sh` (not `.planning/scripts/`)
- Branch naming: `phase-{N}-{slug}` (no gsd/ prefix)

### Open Questions

- Stale lock recovery TTL: 24 hours suggested but needs validation
- Partial merge handling: stop + manual resolution + no auto-cleanup
- Submodule support: incomplete per Git docs, defer to hooks if needed

### TODOs

- [x] Plan Phase 1 with `/gsd:plan-phase 1`
- [x] Implement phase-worktree.sh lock functions (01-02)
- [x] Add worktree subcommands to gsd-tools.cjs (01-01)
- [x] Implement worktree lifecycle operations (01-03)
- [x] Plan Phase 2 Workflow Integration
- [x] Execute 02-01 Post-Create Hooks
- [ ] Execute 02-02 Execute-Phase Integration
- [ ] Execute 02-03 Finalize-Phase Integration

### Blockers

None currently.

## Session Continuity

**Last Session:** 2026-02-20
**Context:** Plan 02-01 (Post-Create Hooks) complete. Ready for Wave 2 plans.

**To Resume:**
1. Execute 02-02 (execute-phase integration)
2. Execute 02-03 (finalize-phase integration)
3. Plans 02-02 and 02-03 can run in parallel (Wave 2)
