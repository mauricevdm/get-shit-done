# Project State: GSD Worktree Isolation

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** Enable parallel phase execution through git worktree isolation — multiple AI sessions can work on different phases simultaneously without file conflicts.

**Current Focus:** Phase 3 - State Reconciliation (STATE.md parsing and merge)

## Current Position

**Phase:** 3 - State Reconciliation
**Plan:** 03-03 complete, Phase 3 complete
**Status:** Phase Complete

```
[################....] 80% - Phase 3 complete
```

**Phases:**
- [x] Phase 1: Foundation (10 requirements) - COMPLETE
- [x] Phase 2: Workflow Integration (7 requirements) - COMPLETE
- [x] Phase 3: State Reconciliation (4 requirements) - COMPLETE (3/3 plans)
- [ ] Phase 4: Polish and Recovery (3 requirements)

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| 4-phase structure | Research recommended: Foundation -> Integration -> Reconciliation -> Polish | 2026-02-20 |
| Directory-based locks | mkdir is POSIX-atomic, survives crashes better than flock | 2026-02-20 |
| JSON registry for worktrees | Explicit state beats parsing git worktree list output | 2026-02-20 |
| Sibling directory worktrees | Predictable paths, no nested .gitignore complexity | 2026-02-20 |
| Lock directory pattern | .planning/worktrees/locks/phase-{N}/ with info.json metadata | 2026-02-20 |
| Stale lock detection via PID | kill -0 to check process existence, return 0 for stale | 2026-02-20 |
| Mark removed worktrees | Preserve history with status: removed instead of deleting | 2026-02-20 |
| Absolute paths in registry | Use path.resolve() for consistent worktree path storage | 2026-02-20 |
| Unlock worktree before remove | Git requires unlock before removing --lock worktrees | 2026-02-20 |
| Non-fatal post-create hooks | npm install and .env copy should warn, not fail worktree creation | 2026-02-20 |
| Dual-path script location | Check project repo first for phase-worktree.sh, then home-installed GSD | 2026-02-20 |
| Idempotent worktree create | Single create command handles existing detection internally | 2026-02-20 |
| Gates must exit 1 | Blocking gates should exit, not just warn - ensures workflow actually stops | 2026-02-20 |
| Cleanup only after merge success | Check MERGE_EXIT before cleanup to protect conflict resolution work | 2026-02-20 |
| ESM-in-CJS pattern | Use dynamic import() with init() for ESM-only remark packages | 2026-02-22 |
| mdast-util-heading-range | Selected for section extraction - handles heading hierarchy correctly | 2026-02-22 |
| Section strategies per CONTEXT.md | Exact match to ownership table (additive, union, union-main-wins-removals, worktree-wins) | 2026-02-22 |
| Three-way diff3 for conflicts | node-diff3 algorithm used by Google Docs, handles line-level conflicts | 2026-02-22 |
| Rollback pattern for merges | Read all versions before modifications to prevent half-merged states | 2026-02-22 |

### Implementation Notes

- Git worktree 2.17+ required for `--lock` flag
- Use `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` for repo root (worktree .git is a file)
- Never `rm -rf` worktree directories, always use `git worktree remove`
- Post-create hooks must run before returning success
- Script path is `get-shit-done/bin/phase-worktree.sh` (not `.planning/scripts/`)
- Branch naming: `phase-{N}-{slug}` (no gsd/ prefix)
- ESM modules in CJS: Use async `init()` with dynamic `import()` for remark ecosystem

### Open Questions

- Stale lock recovery TTL: 24 hours suggested but needs validation
- Partial merge handling: stop + manual resolution + no auto-cleanup
- Submodule support: incomplete per Git docs, defer to hooks if needed

### TODOs

- [x] Plan Phase 1 with `/gsd:plan-phase 1`
- [x] Implement phase-worktree.sh lock functions (01-02)
- [x] Add worktree subcommands to gsd-tools.cjs (01-01)
- [x] Implement worktree lifecycle operations (01-03)
- [x] Plan Phase 2 Workflow Integration
- [x] Execute 02-01 Post-Create Hooks
- [x] Execute 02-02 Execute-Phase Integration
- [x] Execute 02-03 Finalize-Phase Integration
- [x] Execute 03-01 STATE.md Parsing Infrastructure
- [x] Execute 03-02 Section Merge and Conflict Resolution
- [x] Execute 03-03 Finalize-Phase Integration

### Blockers

None currently.

## Session Continuity

**Last Session:** 2026-02-22
**Context:** Phase 3 complete - STATE.md reconciliation fully integrated into finalize-phase workflow.

**To Resume:**
1. Run `/gsd:plan-phase 4` to plan Phase 4: Polish and Recovery
2. Phase 4 covers: orphan detection, cleanup commands, error recovery
